 * If type has more precision than dtype, the endpoints dtype_(min|max) are
 * of the form xxx.5; they are "out of range" because lround() rounds away
 * from 0.  On the other hand, if type has less precision than dtype, then
 * all values that are out of range are integral, so we might as well assume
 * that everything is in range.  At compile time, INRANGE(x) should reduce to
 * two floating-point comparisons in the former case, or TRUE otherwise.
