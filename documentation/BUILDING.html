<h1>Notes on building the library</h1>

<p>In order to build the library, you need a gcc compiler (a cross compiler is reccomended) and
the AmigaOS4 SDK. Everything is already included if you download the cross compiler suite from
<a href="https://github.com/sba1/adtools">https://github.com/sba1/adtools</a>. <br/>
Follow the instructions on adtools site and you are ready to go</p>

<p>There is a makefiles for GCC called(<tt>GNUmakefile.os4</tt>). The file is named in this way because the old
clib4 version that had both .os3 and .os4 versions and adtools is searching for it. <br>
So to compile the lib just do a simply: <br/>
<pre>make -f GNUmakefile.os4</pre><br/>
and the ibrary will be built
